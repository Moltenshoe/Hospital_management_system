# Hospital Management System (HMS) with PyQt5

This is a simple, desktop-based Hospital Management System (HMS) built using Python, PyQt5 for the user interface, and SQLite for the database.

It's designed with three distinct user roles, each with their own permissions and dashboard. The project uses a clean architecture, separating database logic (`db_manager.py`), UI components (in the `ui/` package), and main application control (`main.py`).

## Features

* **Three User Roles:**
    * **Admin:**
        * Approves or denies new, pending user registrations.
        * Manages *all* users in the system (views all, can add new users of any role, can remove any user).
    * **Doctor:**
        * Dashboard is split into "Pending" and "Accepted" patient tabs for better organization.
        * Can "Accept" or "Deny" individual patients.
        * Can **"Accept All"** pending patients at once.
    * **Receptionist:**
        * Creates new patient records.
        * Manages the full patient list, with options to delete patients or assign them to a doctor.
* **Secure Login:** User passwords are "hashed" (encrypted) in the database and checked on login.
* **Registration System:** New doctors and receptionists can register, but their accounts must be approved by an admin before they can log in.
* **Live Data Refresh:** The application automatically polls the database every 5 seconds to refresh the data, ensuring all users see up-to-date information.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    Get the code from this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Moltenshoe/Hospital_management_system.git](https://github.com/Moltenshoe/Hospital_management_system.git)
    cd Hospital_management_system
    ```

2.  **Install Requirements:**
    This project only requires `PyQt5`. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    ```

3.  **Run the App:**
    Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The first time you run it, a new database file named `hms.db` will be created automatically in the same folder.

## Default Admin Login

A default admin account is created automatically when you first run the app.

* **Phone:** `admin`
* **Password:** `admin123`

You can use this account to log in and approve any new "doctor" or "receptionist" accounts you register.
